Challenge: Shopping List App

 Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
In this challenge, you'll practice managing application state. Your challenge will be to careate an application that allows users to add, check, uncheck, and remove items from a shopping list.

Your starting point for this challenge is a repo that contains HTML and CSS starter files for a page that looks like this:

As you can see, we've intentionally gone with a minimal, underdeveloped design for this project. The reason for this is twofold. First, from a learning perspective, we want you to focus on this lesson's main skill: managing state in jQuery web apps. The HTML and CSS skeleton we've provided in the repo allows you to get up and running quickly, without having to think about designing or writing HTML and CSS for now.

Second, when you're writing software professionally, it's almost always preferable to first create an entirely unpolished but functional prototype of the app. This allows you to connect the thread between the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript layer quickly, and to start getting feedback on basic functionality. You may discover that the underlying features of the app need to drastically change or you need to add new elements, and you won't have sunk time into perfecting the styling of your content, which now needs an overhaul. Getting rapid feedback on the underlying functionality of an app is much more important than perfecting the styling at first.

To complete this challenge requires:

Using DOM manipulation and traversal to dynamically add and remove HTML elements and apply styles.
Linking to an externally hosted library (jQuery) and an locally hosted JavaScript file (app.js).
Using this and event delegation
Requirements
In terms of user experience, your shopping list app must allow users to:

enter items they need to purchase by entering text and hitting "Return" or clicking the "Add item" button
check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the "Check" button
permanently remove items from the list
Additionally:

You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
Put your application code in a file called app.js and link to it in index.html
Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest().
Hey friend, we’re here to help! Just a reminder that you can always check out the Q&A sessions if you’re stuck or have questions. Feel free to drop by for a few minutes or the full hour. Happy coding!

Solution
As always, you're on the honor system. Before peeking at this solution, we ask that you spend at least two hours trying to code this project on your own. That doesn't mean you shouldn't reach out for help if you get stuck. If you're stuck, but still within the two hour time limit, reach out to a fellow student or mentor on Slack.
